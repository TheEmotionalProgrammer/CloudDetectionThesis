# Cloud detection on satellite imagery via Deep Learning techniques
This repository contains material related to my BSc thesis project on deep learning techniques for cloud detection, where I built and trained a lightweight U-Net architecture to reach 84% of f1-score on the WHUS2-CD dataset, containing Sentinel-2A satellite imagery.

You can find all the code of the project in the notebook `tesi.ipynb`
